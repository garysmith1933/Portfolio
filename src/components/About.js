                 <p> 
                    I spent years prior to coding searching for the right outlet to express my creativity, from acting, voice acting, and even content creation once upon a time.
                    So when I started to learn how to code back in May 2021, I was shocked by how I addicted I was to it. It reminded me so much of playing video games in a way(which is my main hobby), being able to solve complex problems, and giving me a sense of a accomplishment as I learn and build new things. It was all I can ask for!  
                    A handful of Udemy courses, Fullstack Academy, and some side projects later, here I am actively looking for a company to grow with as a fullstack web developer.

                <p> When i'm not coding you can find me playing video games, cooking, or being forced to feed my two cats...by my two cats. </p>
