                 Prior to coding, I spent years searching for the right outlet to express my creativity. Acting, voice acting, even content creation on Twitch and Youtube once upon a time. 
                 When I started to learn how to code, I was shocked by how addicted I became. It reminded me of playing video games, which is my main hobby. I loved being able to solve complex problems and the sense of accomplishment I got as I learned and built new skills. 
                 It was all I could ask for! I'm now currently looking for a company to grow with as a full stack web developer.
